## Rubik's cube simulator

I guess the only thing special about this is it's 100% original code. I saw an instagram motion artist make this and I thought I'd try to do the same. I love black and white aesthetics so I sticked to that and only added one color for the wireframes.

```C++
//choose center of equilateral triangle
```

The rotation code is messy and while it's not hardcoded it could've been elegant.
